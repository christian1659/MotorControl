# MotorControl
Control System designed for FS racing vehicle, including traction control, torque vectoring and brake regen.
Both PTControl models are the same, apart form their setup, where the plug in model can be directly placed in IPG, as long as its in the same folder,
while the Intergrated model runs IPG co-sim with MATLAB Simulink. For further details how to run both models read the Instruction PDF.
NOTE: to run any of the following models, IPG liscence (preferably 13.0) must be installed on the system.
